## Re: Yesterday

* Seems like people enjoyed lab once they got started.

--

* Big thumbs up for that.

--

* Everybody has trouble getting their code to work
  and gets flustered/frustrated, me included. Doesn't go away.

--

* Last hour or so of lecture was pretty rough yesterday.
  Sorry about that.

## Stuff to Cover Today?

* Teams!
  * Team 0: tucker trevor
  * Team 1: rickard juan
  * Team 2: philip betty
  * Team 3: taylor tylerd
  * Team 4: anthony randy
  * Team 5: henry bob
  * Team 6: sherri tylerj

* Git Branching, Fetching and Merging!
  * Also how to "add collaborators" on Github.

* What are views?!? Write some basic views with ERB!
  * Let's turn Jukeberx into a web app.
  * Easier to play with it in the browser. :)

---

## Plan of Attack

* Let's keep working on Jukeberx.

* I've fixed up what we needed yesterday to get data back from API,
  play songs.

* We've been moving backwards in some sense.

* Often you prototype a web site and then add an API once it stabilizes.

* We've prototyped an API and are now turning it into a web site.

---

## What do we need?

* I need to remember to use branches!

* We should have pages for:
  * Page for artists w/ searchbox
    * Links to see Albums by an artist
  * Page for albums
    * Album art and links to see songs from that album
  * Page for songs
    * Play button to queue a song to be played
  * Homepage with album art, artist, title of current song!
    * And maybe the song queue itself?
    * And probably a stop button for our sanity.

  * BONUS: Add a song queue?

    Have a way to check and see if a song is done playing! [(found)](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14381862)

## Homework

* Finish up those group projects.
  Vedika and I will be around to help with git woes.
