## Description

Build Reddit (bookmarks and voting in Rails using Forms and relationships)

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to ...

* Tie together Models, Views, and Controllers into a functioning app
* Write a basic login system
* Understand how to collaborate with branches and merges/pull requests

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be comfortable:

* Be able to utilize Forms and Links to enable users to navigate the app
* Using Rails Path Helpers
* Using Rails Sessions

## Details

### Deliverables

* A rails app that works as a link sharing site!

### Requirements

* Reddit is "User-generated news links. Votes promote stories to the front page."
* At a bare minimum, there should be users, links, and comments.

## Normal Mode

Normal mode is a simple, naive, implementation of Reddit without voting support.

* Users can sign up and login.
* Logged in users can post links and add comments.
  * Users can delete *their* links or comments.
* All users can see links on the homepage and their comments, ordered by how recent they are.
* Clicking on a link takes you to the thing it links to,
  clicking on comments takes you to a dedicated page for viewing and adding comments, just like reddit.

## Hard Mode

* Users can vote on each link exactly once and votes have a value of -1 or +1.
* Links are ordered by some combination of how recent they are and how many points they have.
* Add pagination to the app with [kaminari][kaminari].

## Insane Mode

* All links can have tags. A route similar to `'tag/:tag_name'` should exist to view links filtered by a certain tag.
* Have a dedicated leaderboard page with the top 10 users by number of upvotes on their links. (Link Karma)
* Make it so links can only be posted once. No reposts!

## Nightmare Mode

* Deploy the app to [Heroku](http://heroku.com)!
  * You'll need to sign up for an [Account](https://signup.heroku.com/login).
  * There's a getting started guide for [deploying Rails apps][heroku-rails4].
* Style it with [Bootstrap][bootstrap] or [Materialize][materialize]!
  * Getting started with Bootstrap and Rails guide [here](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/filling_in_the_layout).

[materialize]: https://materializecss.com/
[heroku-rails4]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4

## Super Nightmare Mode

* Make it so comments can be voted on. Maybe look for a way to do [threaded comments][threaded].

## Notes

* To launch on heroku, you'll need the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
  and a [Heroku Account](https://signup.heroku.com/login)
