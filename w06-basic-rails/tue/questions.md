## Blarg

In this assignment, you'll fork
the Blarg repo from the organization page
and make changes to your fork so that
individual posts can be edited.

### Requirements

* Add a link to the posts allowing
  them to be edited.

* Clicking on the link should take
  you to a form to edit the post.

* Submitting the form should go to
  a method in the controller that
  updates the database.

### BONUS!

* Can you make the form a partial that
  is reused by both the New Post page
  and the Edit Post page?
