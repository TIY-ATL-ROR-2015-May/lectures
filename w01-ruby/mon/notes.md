# Welcome to the Iron Yard!

# Introductions

### Hey, ya'll!

### We're gonna spend plenty of time staring at code.

### Let's get to know each other a bit first.

# Introductions

## Describe when you were first excited by computers or programming.

## How did you wind up at the Iron Yard?

---

# Schedule and Expectations

- Work life balance is important. I'm here to help you as much as possible but:
  * Don't Slack message me after 8pm.
  * I'll try to check Slack a bit over the weekend but there are no guarantees.
  * You may have better lock with email to brit@theironyard.com on weekends.

--

- I need an hour of administrative time in the afternoon for interviews, lecture prep, etc.

--

- I learned Ruby (and Rails) on-the-fly, on-the-job. Tools change. Some of the tools we use
  this semester I'll be using for the first time for the first time.

--

- If you're unclear on anything, ask. I'm still new to teaching, give me feedback so I can do better.

---

# Preliminaries

- How do you Iron Yard?

--

- Ignore the hate/Ignore the hype. Programming is **not** about *tools*.

--

- Programming is all about trade offs. There are no perfect, finished programs.

--

- You will spend half of your working life reading code, not writing it.

> Thus, programs must be written for people to read,
> and only incidentally for machines to execute.

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Preface

---

# Tools Discussion

- History and context is important. Certain things I just want you to know exist. I'll try to let
  you know what's nonessential / just for context. I'll do my best not to go off on tangents. :)

--

## Let's talk a bit about our four main tools: Shell, Editor, Programming Language, Version Control.

- Editor / Programming Language.

--

- Shell. Where did it come from? Why use it?

--

- Version Control. Where did it come from? Why use it?

---

# Package Management

## A Brief Aside

- There is usually system-level package management. That's homebrew.
- There is also language-level package management. That's bundler.

---

# A Shell Checkup

### Commands:

- pwd
- cd
- ls
- cp, mv, rm
- cat / less
- mkdir / rmdir
- clear
- ssh / sudo
- man / woman
- grep

---

# A Shell Checkup

### Concepts:

- files vs directories
- absolute vs relative paths
- hidden files
- tilde / $HOME
- .. / -
- permissions (are a thing we'll get to)
- pipes
- redirection

---

# Start your rubies!

## Let's talk data types!

- Booleans

--

- Numbers

--

- Strings

--

- Symbols

--

- Arrays

---

# Variables and I/O

- Puts
- Gets
- Chomp

---

# Conditionals

### Basics: `if then else elsif end`
### One-legged: `when unless`

---

# Looping and Iteration

## Un-conditionally
- `for i in FOO`
- `times`
- `each`

## Conditionally
- `while`
- `until`

## Ranges!
- `upto`
- `downto`

---

# Methods

### def

### Substitution Model of Evaluation (with caveats)

### Expressions vs Statements

---

# A Brief Aside on Scoping

- Environments
- Bound vs Free variables

---

# A larger example ...

## Let's Fizzbuzz!

---

# `ruby` vs `irb`

## (a.k.a Running and Testing your Damn Code)

- ruby is for running an '.rb' file or script usually
- irb is for trying things out

- You can paste code into irb.
- You should always try out functions (or even just snippets)
  as you go to make sure things behave as you expect.
