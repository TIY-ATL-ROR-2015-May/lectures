* Flesh out the Hangman program we started in class.
  Complete any TODOs to add:
    * A greeting for the user.
    * A prompt that tells the user the partially completed word.
      It may also do input validation (make sure they give a letter)
      or state the number of remaining turns.
    * A game over state that tells the player if they won or lost
      and tells them the word they were trying to guess.
    * **BONUS**: Prompt the player to play another game and continue until they quit.
    * **BONUS**: ASCII art everywhere! ASCII logo, ASCII hangman status!
