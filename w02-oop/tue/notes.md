# It's Time

* **Objects** and **Messages**!

--

* What? Did y'all think I was gonna say "Classes"?

--

* Okay. Those too.

--

* Also, unit testing things!

--

* Maybe even some twitter stuff I hulked out about this weekend?
  Interview question rants, etc.

---

# The Whole "Object Oriented" Thing ...

* Everything we've been working with this whole time
  really is just an object!

* Object(n): A specific data type guaranteed to understand
  a certain set of messages.

* Some interesting methods: .id, .object_id, .class, .ancestors

* Some interesting magic: .send

# How do method calls work? (aka "Dispatch")

---

# Classes are Open

---

# Testing

* TDD, BDD, etc etc.
* Just methods you run to exercise code.

---

# Homework

* OO Hangman w/ Tests?
