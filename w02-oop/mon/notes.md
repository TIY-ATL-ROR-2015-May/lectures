# But first ... Quiz Time!!!

(I know, I know, first thing? Bear with me.)

* It's not for a grade.

* It's to review and reinforce what we've learned.

* Also, it helps get our brains going again.

# So Tic-Tac-Toe Then ...

* I'm gonna write it from scratch.

--

* I'm sleepy so this could backfire.

---

# Regexes!

* Special sublanguage to search for and extract patterns in text.

--

* Great for most simple user input validation.

--

* Not the right tool for highly structured text.

  (I.e. HTML, programming languages, stuff with "a Grammar")

--

* Best way to write them is with some example data.

  (A particularly good tool is [http://rubular.com](http://rubular.com)

# The Wonders of Enumerable

* Enumerable is very much your friend.

--

* Next time you want to do something complicated on an Array, Set, or Hash?
  Start by looking for a similar method in the Enumerable docs.

--

* These methods exist on Arrays, Sets, *and* Hashes!

--

* But how do they get them from Enumerable?

--

* We'll find out tomorrow ...

# Homework
