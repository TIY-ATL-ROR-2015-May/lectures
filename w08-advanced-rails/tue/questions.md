## Expectations

For this assignment, coordinate with your team from last weekend's
cross class project.

## Normal Mode

*  Each of you should pick a model for which
   you will write at least 3 tests tweaking
   fixtures as needed. Ask Vedika or I for help with the tests!

* READ THE DAMN RAILS TESTING GUIDE CHAPTERS (2 & 3)

## Hard Mode

* Read Chapter 4 of the Rails testing guide to prime your brain for tomorrow.

* Ensure that every validation and association on the model is tested.

* Can you think of other properties about the data
  that should be tested or checked?

### Additional Resources

* The [Rails Testing guide][testing],
  especially chapters 2 and 3 about Fixtures and Models
